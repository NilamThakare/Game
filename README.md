This project is a Rock Paper Scissors game developed using Python. It is a console-based application where the user chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The program compares both choices, displays the result (win, lose, or draw), and maintains the score of the user and the computer. The user is also given an option to play the game again. This project demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, random module, and user input handling in Python.
